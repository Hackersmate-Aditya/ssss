So again,Okay,i imported all the necessary liabraries for ex pandas,numpy,etc..
Then i have loaded our dataset which is Attributes sheet from Copy Of Dummy Set
Then checking the columns ot the same and then checked if there any null values are present.If there ,then would probably be replacing with mean of the column.Fortunately,there are no null values in the dataset.Then i checked the shape of dataset(no. of rows and no. of columns).Then basically defining a function named 'trans' in which if the value obtained from the column is 'Yes' ,then function will return 1,and if the value obtained from the column is 'No',then function will return 0.Now,we will apply this function to 'completedSale' table and store it into a new table called 'New' which is also our target variable.Then,we are taking a variable 'x' in which we are storing the only features which will help in getting our result i.e from 'Assetclass.Equity' to 'State.Wyoming'.,and we have taken another variable 'y' in which we have stored 'New'.Now its time to train our model,so i have imported 'train_test_split' for this.And splitted our data into testing and training where testing has 20% of total data in it and remaining 80% has gone in training.I have imported 'StandardScaler' to scale our data on common level and then to fit and transform it.

Now i applied naive bayes classifier on it,gaussian and bernoulli and getting an accuracy of 37.5% & 57.499% in it.
Then i tried to apply Adaboost with it which gives us an accuracy of 55.00001% which is better than of Gaussian.
I even tried multinomial but it was giving an error of negative values in training data.
